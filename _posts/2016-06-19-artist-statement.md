ARTIST STATEMENT

"I use glass to transform light into something that people can be in awe of. Light is is a vehicle into multiple levels of reality as it moves through our spaces; acknowledging what is in front of, behind and around by way of projection reflection and refraction.

In my work I strive to reiterate and to frame light events within an art context, to create places for people to stop, to ponder, and to wonder. My work presents, amplifies, and contains subtle, natural events which would otherwise be lost in our busy lives. 

Using light as a direct metaphor for the spiritual presence, these sculptural installations immerse the viewer in a contemplative experience. This work is my response to our cluttered world, a desire is to create a space in which to heal and calm the soul. I perceive light and space as being beautiful and magical. I believe in the healing power of beauty."
