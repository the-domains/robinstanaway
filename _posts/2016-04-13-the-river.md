THE RIVER installation spans the seventy seven foot length of the Hodge gallery in the Pittsburgh Glass Center. It is composed of more than 200 hand blown glass pieces, each one a study in light and fluidity. The pieces are combined into numerous interconnected mobile sections. As the sections were assembled, they were adjusted to move like  the apparent chaos of water flow and turbulence. Air currents in the room activate the movement of the sculpture. Projected light appears to multiply the glass in light forms on the floor and reflections on the walls. The room is dark and cool like the atmosphere under a bridge.  The River was funded by an Artist as Catalyst residency grant from the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation in the Spring of 2002 and was exhibited at the Pittsburgh Glass Center.  

_Collection of the Artist; Available for exhibition or acquisition for permanent installation. _
