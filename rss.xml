            <title><![CDATA[The River]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The River</h1><p>THE RIVER installation spans the seventy seven foot length of the Hodge gallery in the Pittsburgh Glass Center. It is composed of more than 200 hand blown glass pieces, each one a study in light and fluidity. The pieces are combined into numerous interconnected mobile sections. As the sections were assembled, they were adjusted to move like  the apparent chaos of water flow and turbulence. Air currents in the room activate the movement of the sculpture. Projected light appears to multiply the glass in light forms on the floor and reflections on the walls. The room is dark and cool like the atmosphere under a bridge.  The River was funded by an Artist as Catalyst residency grant from the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation in the Spring of 2002 and was exhibited at the Pittsburgh Glass Center.  </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9a02da1e8226897804fdba1f867f6747a779b07d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Vortex]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Vortex</h1><p>An Installation. A series of 39 hand blown glass vessels, each containing a small amount of water. The vessels are suspended by miniature steel cables in a fifteen foot spiral. Light is projected through the glass creating circular projections and organic reflections on the floor and walls. Each vessel is accessible and the viewer can turn the pieces and touch the water, creating motion. Vortex was exhibited at the P.S. 1 Museum and at the Three Rivers Arts Festival in 1991 and the Susquehanna Art Museum in 2000. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b2d0c818-e01b-4ae0-bc17-504b1a2d81ed.jpg"></article>]]></description>
