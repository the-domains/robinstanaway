            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Vortex</h1><p>An Installation. A series of 39 hand blown glass vessels, each containing a small amount of water. The vessels are suspended by miniature steel cables in a fifteen foot spiral. Light is projected through the glass creating circular projections and organic reflections on the floor and walls. Each vessel is accessible and the viewer can turn the pieces and touch the water, creating motion. Vortex was exhibited at the P.S. 1 Museum and at the Three Rivers Arts Festival in 1991 and the Susquehanna Art Museum in 2000. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b2d0c818-e01b-4ae0-bc17-504b1a2d81ed.jpg"></article>]]></description>
